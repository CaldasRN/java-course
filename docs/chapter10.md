## Chapter 10: Working with Strings
### The Aims
This lab will introduce you to using the Java string classes. 

### Part 1 Manipulating Text
1.	Create a new Java class with a main method called TestStrings. Each of the following questions can be completed in the main method.
2.	Using a String with the value example.doc, change the String to example.bak.
3.	Input two Strings and test them see if they are equal. If they are not equal show which of them lexicographically further forward (in the dictionary!).
4.	Find the number of times "ow" occurs in "the quick brown fox swallowed down the lazy chicken"
5.	Check to see whether a given string is a palindrome (eg "Live not on evil")
### Part 2 Formatting Text
1.	Print today's date in various formats.

### Part 3 Optional Splitting Text
1.	Copy a page of news or other text from your favourite website. Split the text into sentences, count and display them. Next split each sentence into words, count and display the words. Finally split the whole text into words and count them, checking that this is consistent with the results of the previous step.
